    "we introduce a naive implementation of PromptWare that behaves as malware\n",
    "that targets Plan & Execute architectures (a.k.a., ReAct, function calling). We show\n",
    "that attackers could force a desired execution flow by creating a user input that\n",
    "produces desired outputs given that the logic of the GenAI-powered application is\n",
    "known to attackers. We demonstrate the application of a DoS attack that triggers\n",
    "the execution of a GenAI-powered assistant to enter an infinite loop that wastes\n",
    "money and computational resources on redundant API calls to a GenAI engine,\n",

    "In our code we leverage the ReWOO architecture to implement a Plan and Execute system via Langchain and base our code on the publicly aviailable code from the [Langchain repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/examples/rewoo/rewoo.ipynb?ref=blog.langchain.dev)\n",
    " \n",
    "In [ReWOO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18323), Xu, et. al, propose an agent that combines a multi-step planner and variable substitution for effective tool use. It was designed to improve on the ReACT-style agent architecture in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce token consumption and execution time by generating the full chain of tools used in a single pass. (_ReACT-style agent architecture requires many LLM calls with redundant prefixes (since the system prompt and previous steps are provided to the LLM for each reasoning step_)\n",
    "2. Simplify the fine-tuning process. Since the planning data doesn't depend on the outputs of the tool, models can be fine-tuned without actually invoking the tools (in theory).\n",
